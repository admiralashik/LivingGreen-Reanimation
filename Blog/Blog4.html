					<h2>Green Solution Importance</h2>

							<p class="m">Many reasons drive the global push to "go green". 
                                While nature conservation is one of them, ensuring economic and social wellbeing, 
                                mental and physical health, and a sustainable future for humans are some other powerful 
                                incentives.
                            </p>

							 <h3>Reduce the Resource Crunch</h3>

							 <p>Even synthetic products come from natural resources. For example, plastic is made from 4% 
                                of global production of petroleum products and processed by using another 4% of it to 
                                make energy, according to Worldwatch Institute. <br> <br>
                                This reliance on natural resources for material and energy requirement is becoming a 
                                major environmental and economic problem says EcoWatch, depleting resources needed to 
                                "power economies and lift people out of poverty." Since many of the resources are 
                                non-renewable, at current rates of use, the world will run out of many necessary 
                                materials. Even renewable resources are at risk as some need long periods to be 
                                replenished point out Oregon State University.

							<h3>Diminish Air Pollution</h3>
								<p>Use of fossil fuels like petroleum, natural gas, and coal, and burning wood produce 
                                    greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and many harmful chemicals that pollute the air and 
                                    have serious consequences on environment and people's health. <br><br>

                                    There are many ways to reduce emissions and prevent air pollution. Use of alternative 
                                    energy sources that are renewable and sustainable produce little to no emissions and 
                                    therefore improve health and have less environmental impact. Moreover, they are a 
                                    reliable source providing more employment than fossil-fuel based energy, according 
                                    to Union of Concerned Scientists. Similarly, cars running on alternative release 
                                    little or no emissions reports Issues in Science and Technology.

							<h3>Minimize Biodiversity Loss</h3>
								<p>There are an estimated 8.7 to 10 million species on earth, according to a study 
                                    published in Nature.com. Human activities are causing extinction at 8 to 100 times 
                                    the natural level since 1900, in what is called the sixth extinction event notes 
                                    the Guardian. <br><br>

                                    Since habitat loss and fragmentation are the number one reason for species loss, 
                                    reducing paper use and recycling paper saves forests, and species; 40% of woods 
                                    are cut to make pulp for paper and paperboards reports WWF. Reducing consumption 
                                    in general can also help save species, as a 2017 study found many biodiversity 
                                    hotspots are being threatened due to consumer demand. <br><br>

                                    Poaching of species for their body parts like rhino horns, elephants' 
                                    tusk, and tiger skins is the second important cause of biodiversity loss. It is 
                                    being tackled by reducing demand for these items and strict rules to prevent their 
                                    illegal trade.

							<h3>Curtail Climate Change</h3>

								<p>Greenhouse gas emissions that cause air pollution also lead to climate change. Burning 
                                    fossil fuels, deforestation, land-use change, production of nitrogen fertilizers, and 
                                    ruminants (e.g., cows) digestion through human activities, are the reasons behind the 
                                    abrupt global warming reports NASA. <br><br>

                                    Steps are needed to address the effects of climate change. The results are rising 
                                    temperature, melting polar ice-caps and glaciers, rise in sea-level and submergence 
                                    of coastal land, changes in precipitation patters, increase in extreme weather events 
                                    like hurricanes and droughts, and ocean acidification. All of which then impact crops, 
                                    wildlife, and biodiversity notes NASA. The impact can, however, be worse with 
                                    every degree rise in temperature.
