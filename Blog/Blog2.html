                    <h2>Lesser Use of Pesticides</h2>
					<div id="owl">
						<div class="item">
							
                        	<p>What do you think is the main goal of agriculture? Agriculture was developed to produce crops 
								and livestock for human consumption. As the human population increases, the amount of food 
								produced is very important. Unfortunately, there are other organisms out there that want to 
								consume the crops that are meant for humans. Due to this high loss in food production, pesticides 
								are often used to try to combat the problem. Pesticides are chemicals that kill or manage the 
								population of pests. There are many different types of pesticides on the market today, but the 
								most common are herbicides and insecticides, which kill or manage unwanted plants and insects. 
								The damage caused by agricultural pests is a global problem, and over the past half-century, 
								the amount of pesticides used has increased fourfold. Over the years, the widespread use of 
								pesticides has had several benefits and also caused many problems.<br> <br>

								The benefits of pesticides include increased food production, increased profits for farmers 
								and the prevention of diseases. Although pests consume or harm a large portion of agricultural 
								crops, without the use of pesticides, it is likely that they would consume a higher percentage.
							</p>

							<p>Due to the use of pesticides, it is possible to combat pests and produce larger quantities of food. 
								By producing more crops, farmers are also able to increase profits by having more produce to sell. 
								Pesticides also increase farm profits by helping the farmer save money on labor costs. Using 
								pesticides reduces the amount of time required to manually remove weeds and pests from fields.<br> <br> 
								
								In addition to saving crops and livestock, pesticides have also had direct benefits to human 
								health. It is estimated that since 1945, the use of pesticides has prevented the deaths of around 
								seven million people by killing pests that carry or transmit diseases. Malaria, which is 
								transmitted by infected mosquitoes, is one of the most commonly known and deadly diseases that 
								has decreased in prevalence due to the use of pesticides. Other diseases that were minimized 
								due to the use of pesticides include the bubonic plague, which is carried by rat fleas, and 
								typhus, which is transmitted by both fleas and body lice.
							</p>

                            <p>Pesticides can harm public health and the environment. Fortunately, they are not the only means 
								to control plant and animal pests. Successful ways to reduce and even eliminate hazardous 
								pesticide use while keeping pest populations down are being used throughout California farms, 
								cities, forests, parks and schools. Nevertheless, chemical pesticide use continues as the pest 
								management tool of choice. At one end of the pest-management spectrum is conventional, 
								chemical-intensive pest control â€“ the most dangerous and least desirable method.<br> <br> 
								
								At the other end of the spectrum is an array of proven alternatives that put safety, health and 
								environmental sustainability first, and stress an approach to pest management that looks at the 
								whole environment affected by pests.
							</p>

							<p>The conventional system sees pests as intruders that must be removed on principle, generally with 
								toxic, synthetic pesticides. Regardless of health, environmental or sometimes even economic costs, 
								getting rid of the pest is the sole objective. Pests are managed as though they are isolated 
								from the world around them. Sometimes, conventional practitioners apply pesticides even though 
								there is no evidence of the target pest, but simply because it is the time of year when pests 
								might be present.
							</p>

							<p>There are proven alternatives to conventional pesticide use. These approaches consider pest 
								problems within a broad context that considers many factors, including the presence of natural 
								enemies, whether the pest population has been rising or falling, the time of year, and expected 
								weather patterns, all of which can influence whether the pest will flourish or simply die away. 
								These approaches also call for determining if pests are actually causing or are likely to cause 
								damage to health or crops, and, if they are, whether the extent of damage warrants action.<br> <br>

								Showing that these alternatives work, many local governments and school districts now rely on 
								non-pesticide techniques to control pests. And every commercial crop grown in California is grown 
								somewhere using organic methods, which largely exclude hazardous materials.
